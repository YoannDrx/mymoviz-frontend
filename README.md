#  📚 My Moviz

Hi,
I'm Yoann, I'm currently deepening my knowledge in web development. I'm specialized in React frontend development.
I had fun coding all these projects!
Feel free to ask me questions and don't hesitate to look at my other projects ;)
Have fun coding!

## ✍️ Description 

MyMoviz is a React-based application that displays the latest released movies, allowing users to add movies to their favorites, manage a view counter, and rate each movie.

In part 1, the application focuses on React basics such as components and styling.

In part 2, real movie information is added to the application, and the project's style becomes dynamic.

In part 3, states and events are used to customize movie information.

In part 4, the inverse data flow method is used to enhance the list of favorite movies.

In part 5, the application is enriched with a backend, and The Movie Database API is used to enhance the content. Effect hooks are used to load the list of suggested movies, and the project can be deployed.
